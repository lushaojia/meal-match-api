# 4156 Team Project - ASE Aces

## Building, Running, and Testing a Local Instance

- To run the service: `mvn spring-boot:run`
- To run all tests: `mvn test`
- To see the test coverage: `mvn jacoco:report` and open `target/site/jacoco/index.html` in a
  web browser
- To run the style checker: `mvn checkstyle:check`
- To do static analysis with PMD: `mvn pmd:check`

## A Note to Developers

Thank you for considering using our service! To use it, follow these steps:

1. Set up some form of persistent storage. This is required to store the various IDs returned by the service!
2. Make a call to `/api/clientProfiles/create` to register your client app. Store the `clientId` that is returned.
3. Make calls to `/api/accountProfiles/create` to register some accounts. Store the `accountId`s that are returned.
4. With `clientId` and `accountId`, you can now use the other various endpoints in the API.

Each client app _must_ only have one `clientId`! There is no reason for one client to have multiple.

Note that locations are returned in latitude/longitude form â€” you'll have to call a geocoding API to turn it into an address.

## **FoodRequest Endpoints**

### **POST /api/foodRequests/create**

**Expected Input Parameters**:

- `clientId` (Integer): The ID of the client making the request.
- `accountId` (Integer): The ID of the account making the request.
- `listingId` (Integer): The ID of the food listing being requested.
- `quantityRequested` (Integer): The quantity of food being requested.

**Expected Output**:

- A `FoodRequest` object containing details of the newly created request.

This endpoint creates a new food request for the specified account, client, and food listing with
the requested quantity. This is a key step in the process of requesting food from the system.

**Upon Success**:

- **HTTP 201** Status Code is returned along with the created `FoodRequest` in the response body.

**Upon Failure**:

- **HTTP 404** Status Code is returned if any of the specified IDs (clientId, accountId, listingId)
  do not exist.

### **GET /api/foodRequests/get**

**Expected Input Parameters**:

- `requestId` (Integer): The ID of the food request to retrieve.

**Expected Output**:

- A JSON object containing the details of the food request, including:
  - `request_id`: The ID of the food request.
  - `client_id`: The ID of the client making the request.
  - `account_id`: The ID of the account making the request.
  - `listing_id`: The ID of the food listing being requested.
  - `quantity_requested`: The quantity of food requested.
  - `request_time`: The time the request was made.

This endpoint retrieves the details of a food request by its request ID.

**Upon Success**:

- **HTTP 200** Status Code is returned along with the food request details in the response body.

**Upon Failure**:

- **HTTP 404** Status Code is returned if the specified `requestId` does not exist.
- **HTTP 400** Status Code is returned if an error occurs while processing the request.

### **PUT /api/foodRequests/update**

**Expected Input Parameters**:

- `requestId` (Integer): The ID of the food request to update.
- `quantityRequested` (Integer): The new quantity of food requested.

**Expected Output**:

- A message indicating the result of the update operation.

This endpoint updates the quantity of food requested in an existing food request.

**Upon Success**:

- **HTTP 200** Status Code is returned with the message `"Updated Successfully."` in the response
  body.

**Upon Failure**:

- **HTTP 404** Status Code is returned if the specified `requestId` does not exist.

### **Operational Guidelines**

- **Order of API Calls**: The `/create` endpoint should be called before `/get` or `/update` to
  ensure a food request exists.
- **Error Handling**: Proper status codes like `404 Not Found` or `400 Bad Request` will be returned
  for invalid requests or errors.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure valid `clientId`, `accountId`, and `listingId` exist before creating a
  request.

## **ClientProfile Endpoints**

### **POST /api/clientProfiles/create**

**Expected Input Parameters**: N/A\
**Expected Output**: A `ClientProfile` object containing the `client_id` and other details.

  body.

**Upon Failure**:

- **HTTP 500** Status Code is returned in case of any unexpected errors during profile creation.

### **GET /api/clientProfiles/get**

**Expected Input Parameters**:

- `clientId` (Integer): The ID of the client profile to retrieve.

**Upon Failure**:

- **HTTP 404** Status Code is returned if the specified `clientId` does not exist.

### **Operational Guidelines**

- **Order of API Calls**: You should call the `/create` endpoint to create a client profile before
  trying to retrieve it using `/get`.
- **Error Handling**: If a `clientId` does not exist, the service will return a `404 Not Found`
  status code. Ensure that the client ID is valid before making a request to `/get`.
- **Dependencies**: The client profile created by `/create` can be used by other services that
  require a client profile (e.g., creating food requests).
